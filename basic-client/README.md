## INFO
*Simple client sync program*

The simplest implementation of Deepstream. 

Start the server (from the `server` subdirectory) and open `index.html` in two webpages. As you type in the text field on one webpage, it magically updates the other one in realtime.

<hr/>

Code implemented from https://deepstream.io/tutorials/core/getting-started-quickstart/.

The CDN url for the deepstream client found in `index.html` might not always work, depending on how the code gets hosted.
